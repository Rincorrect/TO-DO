I have create a TODO List Web application which includes:
1) Registration of a new user after registration user will be directed on home page or task page.
2) Login (You can use my Login USERNAME: Incorrect    PASSWORD: Rahul@3166)
3) A user can click on plus( + ) icon on the upper left corner to create a new task and it will be added in the list at last. 
4) User can see all the task on the home page itself.
5) To delete a task user have to click on cross symbol then it will direct us to confirm page, where a user can go ahead on deleting a task or go back to the list.
6)  A user can logout by clicking on logout.
